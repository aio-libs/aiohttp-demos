.. _aiohttp-demos-polls-getting-started:

Getting started
---------------

aiohttp server is built around :class:`aiohttp.web.Application` instance.
It is used for registering *startup*/*cleanup* signals, connecting routes etc.

The following code creates an application::

    # main.py
    from aiohttp import web

    app = web.Application()
    web.run_app(app)

Save it under ``aiohttpdemo_polls/main.py`` and start the server using:

.. code-block:: shell

    $ python3 main.py
    ======== Running on http://0.0.0.0:8080 ========
    (Press CTRL+C to quit)

Next, open the displayed link in a browser. It returns a ``404: Not Found``
error. To show something more meaningful than an error, let's create a route
and a view.


.. _aiohttp-demos-polls-views:

Views
-----

Let's start with the first views. Create the file ``aiohttpdemo_polls/views.py``
and add the following to it::

    # views.py
    from aiohttp import web

    async def index(request):
        return web.Response(text='Hello Aiohttp!')

This ``index`` view is the simplest view possible in Aiohttp.

Now, we should create a route for this ``index`` view. Put the following into
``aiohttpdemo_polls/routes.py``. It is a good practice to separate views,
routes, models etc. You'll have more of each file type, and it is nice to group
them into different places::

    # routes.py
    from views import index

    def setup_routes(app):
        app.router.add_get('/', index)


We should add a call to the ``setup_routes`` function somewhere. The best place
to do this is in ``main.py``::

   # main.py
   from aiohttp import web
   from routes import setup_routes

   app = web.Application()
   setup_routes(app)
   web.run_app(app)

Start server again using ``python3 main.py``. This time when we open the browser
we see::

    Hello Aiohttp!

**Success!** Now, your working directory should look like this:

.. code-block:: none

    .
    ├── ..
    └── polls
        └── aiohttpdemo_polls
            ├── main.py
            ├── routes.py
            └── views.py


.. _aiohttp-demos-polls-configuration-files:

Configuration files
-------------------

.. note::

    aiohttp is configuration agnostic. It means the library does not
    require any specific configuration approach, and it does not have built-in
    support for any config schema.

    Please note these facts:

       1. 99% of servers have configuration files.

       2. Most products (except Python-based solutions like Django and
          Flask) do not store configs with source code.

          For example Nginx has its own configuration files stored by default
          under ``/etc/nginx`` folder.

          MongoDB stores its config as ``/etc/mongodb.conf``.

       3. Config file validation is a good idea. Strong checks may prevent
          unnecessary errors during product deployment.

    Thus, we **suggest** to use the following approach:

       1. Push configs as ``yaml`` files (``json`` or ``ini`` is also
          good but ``yaml`` is preferred).

       2. Load ``yaml`` config from a list of predefined locations,
          e.g. ``./config/app_cfg.yaml``, ``/etc/app_cfg.yaml``.

       3. Keep the ability to override a config file by a command line
          parameter, e.g. ``./run_app --config=/opt/config/app_cfg.yaml``.

       4. Apply strict validation checks to loaded dict. `trafaret
          <http://trafaret.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_, `colander
          <http://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/colander/en/latest/>`_
          or `JSON schema
          <http://python-jsonschema.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ are good
          candidates for such job.


One way to store your config is in folder at the same level as `aiohttpdemo_polls`.
Create a ``config`` folder and config file at desired location. E.g.:

.. code-block:: none

    .
    ├── ..
    └── polls                   <-- [BASE_DIR]
        │
        ├── aiohttpdemo_polls
        │   ├── main.py
        │   ├── routes.py
        │   └── views.py
        │
        └── config
            └── polls.yaml      <-- [config file]

Create a ``config/polls.yaml`` file with meaningful option names:

.. code-block:: yaml

    # polls.yaml
    postgres:
      database: aiohttpdemo_polls
      user: aiohttpdemo_user
      password: aiohttpdemo_pass
      host: localhost
      port: 5432
      minsize: 1
      maxsize: 5

Install ``pyyaml`` package::

    $ pip install pyyaml

Let's also create a separate ``settings.py`` file. It helps to leave ``main.py``
clean and short::

    # settings.py
    import pathlib
    import yaml

    BASE_DIR = pathlib.Path(__file__).parent.parent
    config_path = f"{BASE_DIR}/config/polls.yaml"

    def get_config(path):
        with open(path) as f:
            config = yaml.load(f)
        return config

    config = get_config(config_path)


Next, load the config into the application::

    # main.py
    from aiohttp import web

    from settings import config
    from routes import setup_routes

    app = web.Application()
    setup_routes(app)
    app['config'] = config
    web.run_app(app)

Now, try to run your app again. Make sure you are running it from ``BASE_DIR``::

    $ python aiohttpdemo_polls/main.py
    ======== Running on http://0.0.0.0:8080 ========
    (Press CTRL+C to quit)

For the moment nothing should have changed in application's behavior. Since we
see no errors, we succeeded in learning how to configure our application.


.. _aiohttp-demos-polls-database:

Database
--------

Server
^^^^^^
Here, we assume that you have running database and a user with write access.
Refer to :ref:`aiohttp-demos-polls-preparations-database` for details.

Schema
^^^^^^

We will use SQLAlchemy to describe database schema for two related models,
``question`` and ``choice``::

    +---------------+               +---------------+
    | question      |               | choice        |
    +===============+               +===============+
    | id            | <---+         | id            |
    +---------------+     |         +---------------+
    | question_text |     |         | choice_text   |
    +---------------+     |         +---------------+
    | pub_date      |     |         | votes         |
    +---------------+     |         +---------------+
                          +-------- | question_id   |
                                    +---------------+

Create ``db.py`` file with database schemas::

    # db.py
    from sqlalchemy import (
        MetaData, Table, Column, ForeignKey,
        Integer, String, Date
    )

    meta = MetaData()

    question = Table(
        'question', meta,

        Column('id', Integer, primary_key=True),
        Column('question_text', String(200), nullable=False),
        Column('pub_date', Date, nullable=False)
    )

    choice = Table(
        'choice', meta,

        Column('id', Integer, primary_key=True),
        Column('choice_text', String(200), nullable=False),
        Column('votes', Integer, server_default="0", nullable=False),

        Column('question_id',
               Integer,
               ForeignKey('question.id', ondelete='CASCADE'))
    )


.. note::

    It is possible to configure tables in a declarative style like so:

    .. code-block:: python

        class Question(Base):
            __tablename__ = 'question'

            id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
            question_text = Column(String(200), nullable=False)
            pub_date = Column(Date, nullable=False)


    But it doesn't give much benefits later on. SQLAlchemy ORM doesn't work in
    asynchronous style and as a result ``aiopg.sa`` doesn't support related ORM
    expressions such as ``Question.query.filter_by(question_text='Why').first()``
    or ``session.query(TableName).all()``.

    You still can make ``select`` queries after some code modifications:

    .. code-block:: python

        from sqlalchemy.sql import select
        result = await conn.execute(select([Question]))

    instead of

    .. code-block:: python

            result = await conn.execute(question.select())

    But it is not as easy to deal with as update/delete queries.


Now we need to create tables in database as it was described with sqlalchemy.
Helper script can do that for you. Create a new file, ``init_db.py``::

    # init_db.py
    from sqlalchemy import create_engine, MetaData

    from settings import config
    from models import question, choice


    DSN = "postgresql://{user}:{password}@{host}:{port}/{database}"

    def create_tables(engine):
        meta = MetaData()
        meta.create_all(bind=engine, tables=[question, choice])


    def sample_data(engine):
        conn = engine.connect()
        conn.execute(question.insert(), [
            {'question_text': 'What\'s new?',
             'pub_date': '2015-12-15 17:17:49.629+02'}
        ])
        conn.execute(choice.insert(), [
            {'choice_text': 'Not much', 'votes': 0, 'question_id': 1},
            {'choice_text': 'The sky', 'votes': 0, 'question_id': 1},
            {'choice_text': 'Just hacking again', 'votes': 0, 'question_id': 1},
        ])
        conn.close()


    if __name__ == '__main__':
        db_url = DSN.format(**config['postgres'])
        engine = create_engine(db_url)

        create_tables(engine)
        sample_data(engine)

.. note::

    A more advanced version of this script is mentioned in :ref:`aiohttp-demos-polls-preparations-database` notes.


Install the ``aiopg[sa]`` package to interact with the database and run the script::

    $ pip install aiopg[sa]
    $ python init_db.py

.. note::

    At this point we are not using any async features of the package. For this
    reason, you could have installed ``psycopg2`` package. Though since we are
    using sqlalchemy, we also could switch the type of database server.

Now there should be one record for *question* with related *choice* options
stored in corresponding tables in the database.


.. _aiohttp-demos-polls-creating-connection-engine:

Creating connection engine
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For making DB queries we need an engine instance. Assuming ``conf`` is
a :class:`dict` with the configuration info for a Postgres connection, this
could be done by the following coroutine:

.. literalinclude:: ../demos/polls/aiohttpdemo_polls/db.py
  :pyobject: init_pg

The best place for connecting to the DB is using the
:attr:`~aiohtp.web.Application.on_startup` signal::

   app.on_startup.append(init_pg)


.. _aiohttp-demos-polls-graceful-shutdown:

Graceful shutdown
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It is a good practice to close all resources on program exit.

Let's close the DB connection with the :attr:`~aiohtp.web.Application.on_cleanup`
signal::

    app.on_cleanup.append(close_pg)


.. literalinclude:: ../demos/polls/aiohttpdemo_polls/db.py
  :pyobject: close_pg


.. _aiohttp-demos-polls-templates:

Templates
---------

Let's add more views:

.. literalinclude:: ../demos/polls/aiohttpdemo_polls/views.py
  :pyobject: poll

Templates are a very convenient way for web page writing. If we return a
dict with page content, the ``aiohttp_jinja2.template`` decorator
processes the dict using the jinja2 template renderer.

For setting up the template engine, we install the ``aiohttp_jinja2``
library first:

.. code-block:: shell

   $ pip install aiohttp_jinja2

After installing, we setup the library::

    import aiohttp_jinja2
    import jinja2

    aiohttp_jinja2.setup(
        app, loader=jinja2.PackageLoader('aiohttpdemo_polls', 'templates'))


In the tutorial we place template files under
``polls/aiohttpdemo_polls/templates`` folder.


.. _aiohttp-demos-polls-static-files:

Static files
------------

Any web site has static files such as: images, JavaScript sources, CSS files

The best way to handle static files in production is by setting up a reverse
proxy like NGINX or using CDN services.

During development, handling static files using the aiohttp server is very
convenient.

Fortunately, this can be done easily by a single call:

.. literalinclude:: ../demos/polls/aiohttpdemo_polls/routes.py
  :pyobject: setup_static_routes

where ``project_root`` is the path to the root folder.


.. _aiohttp-demos-polls-middlewares:

Middlewares
-----------

Middlewares are stacked around every web-handler. They are called
before the handler for a pre-processing request. After getting
a response back, they are used for post-processing the given response.

A common use of middlewares is to implement custom error pages. Example from
:ref:`aiohttp-web-middlewares` documentation will render 404 errors using a
JSON response, as might be appropriate for a REST service.

Here we'll create a little bit more complex middleware custom display pages
for *404 Not Found* and *500 Internal Error*.

Every middleware should accept two parameters, a *request* and a *handler*,
and return the *response*. Middleware itself is a *coroutine* that can modify
either request or response:

Now, create a new ``middlewares.py`` file:

.. literalinclude:: ../demos/polls/aiohttpdemo_polls/middlewares.py

As you can see, we do nothing *before* the web handler. We choose Jinja2
template renderer based on ``response.status``  *after* the request was handled.
In case of exceptions, we do something similar, based on ``ex.status``.
Without the ``create_error_middleware`` function, the same task would take us
many more ``if`` statements.

We have registered middleware in ``app`` by adding it to ``app.middlewares``.

Now, add a ``setup_middlewares`` step to the main file:

.. code-block:: python
    :emphasize-lines: 6, 10

    # main.py
    from aiohttp import web

    from settings import config
    from routes import setup_routes
    from middlewares import setup_middlewares

    app = web.Application()
    setup_routes(app)
    setup_middlewares(app)
    app['config'] = config
    web.run_app(app)

Run the app again. To test, try an invalid url.
